# Random Terrain Generation
A simple program that makes a random Terrain which consists of 3 types of materials which are
water, sand and land. Each time it generates a map you can use the DOWN and RIGHT arrow keys
to explore to the right and left of this random terrain.

WARNING : Currently I render the random part of the map when the button is pressed so if you do something
along the lines of hold right and then press down, you will have a discontinuity in the map

You can hold DOWN and RIGHT at the same time to explore in the bottom right direction tho!
This is just a fun project to help me understand how to use perlin noise
